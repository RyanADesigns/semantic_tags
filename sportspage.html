          Instant replay, Stubhub and that yellow first down line are just as important, if not more than anything Apple comes out with. The games themselves, <em> and the ways that we are able to watch them </em> , have been positively impacted by technology and without it, we might as well go back to short shorts, high socks and Afros</p>.

          <p>With legendary teams and rivalries in all four sports it's no wonder that this region is a hotbed for the traditional. For teams that call the Northeast home, there are over 110 championship titles within the NFL, NBA, NHL & Major 
            <a href='http://www.espn.com/mlb/standings'>League Baseball</a>.
Eleven states make up this region: Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Vermont.
Traditional sports are not the only ones that have made their mark. NASCAR may have been born in the South but its success is quickly moving north. Each year, Dover International Speedway in Delaware and Pocono Raceway in Pennsylvania host two NASCAR Sprint Cup Series and New Hampshire Motor Speedway hosts one Sprint Cup event.</p>

           <h2>Fields and Areas</h2>
           <p>The Hershey-Harrisburg area in Pennsylvania was recently dubbed the 'Nations Top Minor League Market.' As home to the AHL Hershey Bears; the AA affiliate of the Washington Nationals, Harrisburg Senators; and the City Islanders of the United Soccer League's Second Division this title simply makes sense.
"We are a minor league hotbed," said Gregg Cook, sports marketing manager of the Hershey/Harrisburg Regional Visitors Bureau. "We have the success of those franchises from a business standpoint and respectability in the local market. But the fan and corporate support are also there and the facilities where they play are gorgeous."
He's referring to the Giant Center and Metro Bank Park as well as several other facilities in the immediate area.</p>
